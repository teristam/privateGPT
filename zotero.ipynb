We want to develop\\nscreens that distinguish between malfunction in that mechanism, on\\nthe one hand, and, on the other hand, alteration in the processes that\\nextract from experience the information that goes into that memory\\n(learning processes) or alteration in processes that translate the stored\\ninformation into observable behavior (performance processes).\\n\\nGenetic and/or pharmacological manipulations may affect mea-\\nsures of the strength, speed, or frequency of a learned behavior\\nthrough alteration of any of the three kinds of processes (learning,\\nmemory, and performance). Thus, measures such as the latency to\\nreach the platform in the Morris water maze are not promising\\ncandidates for the kind of screen we seek. An alternative to\\nmeasuring the strength of learned behavior is to screen for behav-\\niorally manifest distortions or degradations in the content of mem-\\nory (Church & Meck, 1988). If the mechanism that carries quan-\\ntitative information forward in time delivers back values that differ\\nsystematically from those put in, then it introduces systematic\\nerror. If it delivers values that are more variable than the values put\\nin, then it degrades the information. The question we pose is\\nwhether the systematic errors and trial-to-trial variability in timed\\nbehavior come in appreciable measure from the memory mecha-\\nnism, as just delimited.\\n\\nThe probability of conditioned behavior often peaks at approx-\\nimately the time at which reinforcement is expected (Bevins,\\nMcPhee, Hauhut, & Ayres, 1997; Bolles & Moot, 1973; LaBarbera\\n& Church, 1974; Roberts & Church, 1978; White, Kehoe, Choi, &\\nMoore, 2000), which implies that information about the reinforce-\\nment latency has been extracted from past experience and carried\\nforward in memory (Fantino, 1969; Gibbon, Church, & Meck,\\n1984; Killeen, 1975; Savastano & Miller, 1998). The timing of the\\nbehavior commonly exhibits both systematic error in the mean and\\ntrial-to-trial variability (Gibbon et al., 1984), and these parameters\\nof the behavior differ from subject to subject (Gallistel & Gibbon,\\n2000), suggesting their utility in genetic screening.\\n\\nThe most frequently used, and most thoroughly analyzed, ex-\\nperimental paradigm for the study of temporal memory is the peak\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c4\\n\\nGALLISTEL, KING, AND MCDONALD\\n\\nprocedure (Catania, 1970; Cheng & Westwood, 1993; Cheng,\\nWestwood, & Crystal, 1993; Church, Meck, & Gibbon, 1994;\\nRoberts & Church, 1978). In this procedure, responding delivers\\nreward at a fixed interval after the onset of a warning signal,\\ncommonly called the conditioned stimulus (CS). The duration of\\nthe interval between CS onset and the time after which responding\\nproduces food is called the target time. Typically, subjects start to\\nrespond well before the target time, suggesting that there is some\\nnoise (hence, uncertainty) in their representation of the target time.\\nOn some trials, called probe trials, the reward is not delivered. On\\nthese trials, subjects stop responding at some point after the target\\ntime has past. Thus, responding on probe trials usually brackets the\\ntarget time.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the distribution of responding in\\ntime—when subjects start and when subjects stop relative to the\\ntarget time—appears to be unaffected by the motivational state of\\nthe subject. By contrast, the strength (frequency) of responding in\\nthis same task depends strongly on motivation (Roberts, 1981).\\nThis is one example of a performance factor that has a large effect\\non the strength of the behavior but little effect on a measure of the\\ncontents of memory.', metadata={'source': 'E:/Dropbox/zotero\\\\Gallistel et al_2004_Sources of Variability and Systematic Error in Mouse Timing Behavior.pdf'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The peak curves from sessions with different target times very\\nnearly superpose when plotted against the elapsed proportion of\\nthe target time (normalized trial time). This means that both the\\nlocations (central tendencies) and the spread (standard deviations)\\nof the start and stop distributions were nearly fixed proportions of\\nthe target times. Scalar variability—variability proportionate to the\\ntarget time—is a ubiquitous feature of timing data (Gibbon, 1977,\\n1991; Killeen & Weiss, 1987). Secondly, the superposed plots are\\nnot centered about the target time (which is at 1 on the normalized\\ntime axis). This means that the average center of a run, the point\\nhalfway between the start and the stop, deviated significantly from\\nthe target time. This is a systematic error in the timing of the\\nbehavior. This systematic error was also proportional to the target\\nlatency, a phenomenon known as scalar error. The distinction\\nbetween systematic error and trial-to-trial variability in timing\\nbehavior is the same as the distinction between systematic error\\nand random error in, for example, the targeting of a rifle. It is the\\ndistinction between the location of the mean relative to the target\\n(the systematic error) and the dispersion about that mean (the\\nvariability). In our case, it is the distinction between the location of\\nthe average center of a run relative to the target time and the\\nstandard deviation of the starts and stops of the runs.\\n\\nThe scalar variability in run starts and stops and the scalar error\\nin run centers have been attributed to the memory for target time\\n(Gibbon et al., 1984; Meck & Church, 1987).

Our work follows up on their insight and their analyses. If\\nthe variability in starts and stops derives from memory noise, then\\nsamples from two different target memories should not covary.\\nThe trial-to-trial variations in the values read from one target\\nmemory (say, the memory for feedings that have occurred 5 s into\\na trial) should not predict the trial-to-trial variations in the values\\nread from different target memories (the memories for feedings\\nthat have occurred 15 s or 45 s into a trial). A late start on the run\\nat the first target (5 s) should predict a late stop on that same run,\\nbecause both the start and the stop of a given run are based on the\\nsame value read from memory, but it should not predict a late stop\\non the run at a later target in the same trial, because that target\\nderives from the reading of a different memory (the memory for\\nthe target for that later run). Memory noise (variability) is equiv-\\nalent in its effects on start and stop times to the effect of changing\\nthe locations of a bus stop on the arrival time of a bus. Moving the\\nlocation earlier in the route causes the bus to arrive at that stop\\nearlier; moving it farther along the route causes the bus to arrive\\nlater. But movements in the location of one stop should not affect\\narrival times at other stops.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the trial-to-trial variability in starts and\\nstops arises from trial-to-trial variability in how fast the timer runs,\\na late start on the run at the short latency target (due to a slower\\nthan usual timing) will predict that all subsequent starts and stops\\nwill also be late. To continue the bus analogy, if the bus is slow en\\nroute to the first stop, hence late getting to it, it will tend to be late\\nat all of the subsequent stops as well. This consideration led us to\\nthe tripeak procedure (Fetterman & Killeen, 1995). In our version\\nof this procedure, food is delivered at a randomly chosen one of\\nthree hoppers, each with a different food-delivery latency. On\\ntrials when it is the longest latency hopper that delivers, the mouse\\ntends to poke first into the short-latency hopper, then into the\\nmidlatency hopper, and finally into the long-latency hopper. By\\ncomparing within- and cross-target covariances in starts and stops,\\nwe estimate the extent to which trial-to-trial variability depends on\\nvariability in the timer (bus speed) rather than variability in the\\nremembered targets (the locations of the bus’s destinations).\\n\\nAn alternative, nonmnemonic source of the scalar error in the\\naverage center of a run would be systematic differences in how far\\nfrom the target time the subject placed its start and stop criteria.\\nFollowing Gibbon (1977), we assume that starts and stops are the\\nresults of a decision process in which the subject compares its\\nconstantly growing estimate of the time elapsed on this trial with\\nthe remembered target time. It starts to respond when the propor-\\ntion between the two exceeds a critical value (the start criterion)\\nand stops when it exceeds a higher one (the stop criterion). If a\\nsubject adopts a stop criterion proportionately closer to the target\\ntime than its start criterion, the average center of a run will be short\\nof the target time. To the extent that systematic error is due to the\\nasymmetric placement of start and stop criteria, it reflects perfor-\\nmance factors rather than the miscalibration of memory.', metadata={'source': 'E:/Dropbox/zotero\\\\Gallistel et al_2004_Sources of Variability and Systematic Error in Mouse Timing Behavior.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In work leading to the suggestion that scalar error in memory\\nreflected a miscalibration of memory, it was assumed that the\\nplacement of the start and stop criteria relative to the remembered\\ntarget time was determined by a single quantity (Gibbon et al.,\\n1984; see also Cheng, 1992). We call this quantity the hedge\\nfactor, on the decision-theoretic assumption that the distance away\\nfrom the remembered target time at which subjects place their start\\n\\nand stop criteria reflects the degree of their uncertainty about when\\nthe target is reached. The greater their uncertainty is, the greater is\\nthe amount by which they hedge their starts and stops by placing\\ntheir decision criteria farther from the remembered target. If there\\nis only one hedge factor, then any manipulation that moves the\\nstart criterion closer to the target time will likewise move the stop\\ncriterion closer to it, and by the same amount (cf. Cheng, 1992). If,\\non the other hand, subjects determine their start and stop criteria\\nindependently, then a manipulation might cause them to move in\\ndifferent directions relative to the target time and/or move by\\ndifferent amounts. This consideration was our reason for running\\nthe same subjects with the same three target times first in the\\nsingle-peak procedure and then in the tripeak procedure. We\\nthought that if start and stop criteria are independently placeable,\\nthen the shift from the single-peak procedure to the tripeak pro-\\ncedure might cause asymmetric displacements of the start and stop\\ncriteria. This would be evidence that systematic errors in the\\nsingle-peak data were likely to be the result of the asymmetric\\nplacement of decision criteria.\\n\\nWe first ran 6 mice in the peak procedure using an unusually\\nbroad spread of target intervals (5 s, 15 s, and 45 s—a nine-fold\\nrange). Then we ran the same subjects in a variant of the peak\\nprocedure similar to one first used by Fetterman and Killeen\\n(1995), in which multiple target times are used (the tripeak pro-\\ncedure; see Matell, King, & Meck, in press, for an earlier use of\\nthis procedure with mice). In our version of the tripeak procedure,\\nthe subjects were presented with three illuminated hoppers on each\\ntrial, only one of which paid off. When a hopper paid off, it did so\\nat the target time associated with that hopper throughout testing.\\nSubjects, however, did not know which hopper would pay off on\\nany given trial. Therefore, we expected them to sample them in the\\norder of their target times, poking first in the 5-s hopper, then, if\\nthat failed, in the 15-s hopper, and finally, if that also failed, in the\\n45-s hopper. This task may also be thought of as a time–place task.\\nThe subjects learn that food is likely to be available at different\\nplaces at different times after CS onset (Carr & Wilkie, 1998;\\nWilkie, 1995; Wilkie & Wilson, 1992). Their behavior is con-\\ntrolled by the conjunction of memories for time (the feeding\\nlatency) and place (which hopper).\\n\\nMethod\\n\\nSubjects\\n\\nThe subjects were 6 female Swiss-Webster ND4 mice (Harlan, India-\\nnapolis, IN), aged about 12 weeks and weighing between 19 g and 22 g on\\nthe first day of the experiment. They were individually housed in plastic\\ntubs and maintained on a 12:12 hr photoperiod, with lights on at 2200 hr.\\nBehavioral testing occurred during the dark phase of the photoperiod.\\nStarting on the first day of the study, access to food was restricted. The\\namount of food obtained during the experimental sessions was supple-\\nmented at the end of each session to maintain body weight at approxi-\\nmately 90% of the free-feeding weight.

A control hopper (identical to the other hoppers but not\\nconnected to a pellet dispenser) was located on the opposite wall. The\\nhoppers were cubic hoppers 2.4 cm on a side equipped with an infrared\\n(IR) beam that detected nose pokes and with a light that illuminated the\\ninterior of the hopper. The chambers were also equipped with a tone\\ngenerator (2900 Hz) and a white noise generator (80 dB, flat 10 –25,000\\nHz). If the subject’s head was already in the hopper when the program\\narmed the feeder, the delivery of a 20-mg pellet (Research Diets, New\\nBrunswick, NJ, Model PJA1 00020) was immediate; otherwise, it occurred\\nat the onset of the next interruption. All aspects of the experimental\\nprotocol were controlled by computer software (Med-PC, Med Associates),\\nwhich also logged and time stamped the events—the onsets and offsets of\\ninterruptions of the IR beams in the hoppers; the onsets and offsets of\\ntones, noises, and hopper illuminations; and the delivery of food pellets.\\nEvent times were recorded with a resolution of 20 ms.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nSubjects were weighed at the start of each session, then placed in the operant\\nchambers. During single-peak procedure sessions (Phases 1–4), the opportu-\\nnity to begin a trial was signaled by the illumination of the control hopper and\\nthe onset of white noise. These stimuli remained present until the subject\\npoked its nose into the control hopper. When the poke was detected, the\\ncontrol hopper illumination and white noise terminated, the target hopper was\\nilluminated, the tone turned on, and the feeding clock started.\\n\\nA random 4 out of 5 trials were feeding trials, on which the feeder was\\narmed when the feeding clock reached the target latency (T*). A single\\npellet was delivered at T* if the subject’s head was in the hopper (inter-\\nrupting the IR beam) when arming occurred; otherwise, the first poke\\nthereafter triggered its delivery. The tone terminated immediately follow-\\ning pellet delivery. The illumination of the hopper terminated 5 s later.\\nWhen the mouse did not interrupt the IR beam in the hopper at or after T*,\\nthe trial ended after 3T* (cid:3) E(T), where E(T) is an interval chosen from an\\nexponential distribution with an expectation of T*. Probe trials, when no\\nfood was delivered regardless of behavior at or after T*, constituted a\\nrandom 1 out of 5 trials. On these trials, the hopper remained illuminated\\nand the tone remained on for an interval equal to 2T* (cid:3) E(T).', metadata={'source': 'E:/Dropbox/zotero\\\\Gallistel et al_2004_Sources of Variability and Systematic Error in Mouse Timing Behavior.pdf'}),\n",

Because the\\nsessions were so long, there was a substantial chance that the mouse might\\ngo to sleep for parts of them. For that reason, we made the trials self-\\npaced—the mouse initiated each trial. A second motivation for having the\\ntrials initiated by the mouse poking into a separate hopper (the control\\nhopper) was that it guaranteed that a poke was not in progress at the start\\nof a trial. Moreover, it controlled the mouse’s position at the start of each\\ntrial, which is important when the timing of the first response is a variable\\nof interest. The number of trials in a session was largely determined by the\\nsubject, ranging from 75 to 250.\\n\\nOn both feeding and probe trials, we extracted from the recorded onsets\\nand offsets of beam interruptions in the hopper the sequence of head-out\\nand head-in intervals.

If all\\nof the factors determining whether the mouse has its head in the\\nhopper at a given point in a trial scaled with the target time, then\\nthese plots would superpose. If they did superpose, then the plots\\nof normalized start and stop times in Figure 7 would be flat, but\\nthey are not. The departures from flatness—from constant propor-\\ntionality—are significant in each subject ( p generally (cid:4) .001,\\nfrom one-way analyses of variance [ANOVAs]). Thus, the loca-\\ntions of the start and stop times relative to the target time do not\\nscale completely with target time.\\n\\nWhen the target time is increased from 5 s to 45 s, the average\\nstart proportions and the average stop proportions both move\\ntoward 1, that is, starts and stops get proportionately closer to the\\ntarget time.

The values for start CVs were also\\nnotably more variable than for stop CVs, both within subjects\\n(across target times) and between subjects.

A single-\\nhedge model predicts that the center CV should be less than both\\nthe start and the stop CVs (Church et al., 1994; King et al., 2001),\\nwhich it consistently is not. The single-hedge model predicts this\\nbecause in it, trial-to-trial variations in start and stop times are\\nnegatively correlated and their effects on the center time are\\nmutually annulling. Late starts (due to a smaller than usual hedge\\non that trial) should be accompanied by early stops (likewise due\\nto the smaller than usual hedge on that trial), and these oppositely\\nsigned variations have an opposing (mutually annulling) effect on\\nthe location of the center.\\n\\nThe correlation between run centers and run durations was\\nvariable (M (cid:1) 0.29, (cid:1) (cid:1) .29). In all 18 cases, however, it was less\\nthan the ratio of the center and duration CVs, often much less.\\nIndeed, in three cases it was negative. Again, this comparison is\\nimportant in deciding between different models. In the single-\\nhedge model, variance in the memory sample is the sole source of\\nthe variance of the center but one of two sources for the variance\\nof the duration; the other being variance in the hedge factor. If\\nmemory were the sole source for both center and duration vari-\\nance, then the CVs for the center and the duration would be equal\\nand the correlation between them would be perfect: The duration\\nof a head poke would vary from trial to trial in proportion as its\\n\\ncenter was late or early. To the extent that variance in the hedge\\nfactor contributes to variance in the duration (but not the center),\\nthe CV for the duration should be greater than the CV for the\\ncenter. This further source of variation in the duration should\\ndiminish the correlation between it and the center. Thus, the\\nestimate for the correlation between center and duration should\\napproximate the ratio of the center CV to the duration CV. In fact,\\nhowever, this correlation is reliably less than this ratio, as pre-\\ndicted by a two-hedge model (see Church et al., 1994; King et al.,\\n2001, for more on this topic).\\n\\nThe start(cid:6)stop correlations were positive in all 18 cases and did\\nnot differ as a function of target time (mean across subjects and\\ntargets (cid:1) 0.45).

       " Document(page_content='Discussion\\n\\nThe Sources of Systematic Error\\n\\nOur results are not consistent with the single-hedge model, the\\nmodel in which the start proportion and stop proportion deviate\\nfrom 1 by the same value (the common hedge factor). Both the\\nsingle-peak and the tripeak results give strong grounds for reject-\\ning this model. The simplest, most direct evidence against it is our\\nfinding that the start and stop proportions are affected differently\\nby different target durations in single-peak sessions and by the\\ntripeak procedure. In Figure 7A, one sees that the 15-s start\\nproportion in 5 of 6 mice is farther from 1 than is the 5-s start\\nproportion, whereas the stop proportion at 15 s is closer to 1 than\\nat 5 s. This cannot happen in the single-hedge model. If one\\nproportion gets closer to 1, so must the other, because their\\ndistance from the remembered target time is determined by a\\ncommon hedge factor. In the same vein, the tripeak procedure\\ncaused the start proportions at the 5-s hopper to move closer to 1,\\nwhereas the stop proportions at this hopper moved further from 1\\n(Figure 8A). It also caused the starts at the 15-s hopper to move\\nmuch closer to 1 (relative to their location in the single-peak\\nprocedure), while having no significant effect on the location of\\nthe stops.\\n\\nLess simple but equally important is the failure of the correla-\\ntion structure to conform to the predictions of the single-hedge\\nmodel, as has been clearly recognized in previous work on the\\nstatistics of single trials (Brunner, Fairhurst, Stolovitzky, & Gib-\\nbon, 1997; Church et al., 1994). On this model, start and stop times\\nshould be negatively correlated, because a small hedge factor leads\\nto a late start and an early stop. But starts and stops are invariably\\npositively correlated, in both the single-peak and the tripeak pro-\\ncedure; late starts tend to be paired with late stops.

       " Document(page_content='Our results imply a model in which start and stop decisions are\\npartially independent. Once it is recognized that start and stop\\nproportions are at least partially independently determined, then it\\nis clear that modest systematic error in the location of the peak\\ncurve is likely to be the result of asymmetric start and stop decision\\ncriteria. The start criterion on a given trial is the proportion of the\\nremembered target time that the estimate of elapsed time on the\\ncurrent trial must exceed in order for the subject to start its run.\\nSimilarly, the stop criterion is the proportion by which the esti-\\nmated elapsed interval must exceed the remembered target time in\\norder for the subject to stop its run. If, on average, the subject puts\\nits start criterion farther from 1 than its stop criterion, then the\\nlocation of its peak curve will be centered left of 1. If the asym-\\nmetry goes the other way, it will be centered right of 1. Thus,\\nmemory miscalibration is unlikely to be the source of the modest\\nsystematic errors seen in normal subjects.\\n\\nThis conclusion is consistent with the clear lability in the start\\nand stop proportions seen in our results. One consequence of this\\nlability is that, although there are systematic errors in the locations\\nof the peak curves, they are not scalar errors. Thus, for example,\\nthe fact that in the single-peak data, the start proportions lie farther\\nfrom 1 when the target is 15 s than they do when it is 5 s, whereas\\nthe opposite is true for the stop proportions, means that in all 5 of\\nthose mice the systematic error is proportionately greater with a\\n15-s target than with a 5-s target (see, e.g., Figure 6). When we use\\nthe tripeak procedure, the systematic error for a 15-s target re-\\nverses. In the tripeak procedure, the average center of a run at the\\n15-s hopper, expressed as a proportion of the target, was 1.06\\n(SE (cid:1) 0.02). In the single-peak procedure, it was 0.90 (SE (cid:1) 0.03).\\nA miscalibrated memory mechanism, which delivers back val-\\nues that deviate systematically from the values originally put in\\n(Gibbon et al., 1984), may be a factor in producing systematic\\nerror, but the effects of systematic memory error cannot be distin-\\nguished from the effects of asymmetrically placed decision criteria\\nwhen the peak curve straddles the target value. If, however, one\\nfound a subject whose peak curve lay almost entirely to one side\\nof the target time, then a gross systematic error of that kind could\\nnot be explained by asymmetric decision criteria. Presumably, a\\nhedge factor cannot be less than zero. When a start hedge or a stop\\nhedge factor is zero, the median of that distribution will be at the\\nremembered target time. If the median of either distribution were\\nto fall on the wrong side of the target time, then systematic\\nmisremembering of the target time (memory miscalibration) would\\nbe the more plausible explanation.\\n\\nThe Sources of Variability\\n\\nStarts, stops, and peaks.\\n\\nIt is common in the analysis of peak\\ndata to treat the ratio of the width of the peak curve to its center as\\n\\na measure of the variability in performance (e.g., Rakitin et al.,\\n1998). In light of our results, this is not a valid measure of\\nvariability, because the width of the peak curve depends not on\\nvariability per se, but rather on how far apart the subject places its\\nstart and stop decision criteria. The more widely separated these\\ncriteria, the wider the resulting peak function. The peak curve for\\nthe 15-s hopper is dramatically narrower in the tripeak condition\\nthan in the single-peak condition (compare the second and fourth\\npanels from the top in Figure 9), but that is not primarily because\\nthe behavior was less variable in the latter condition.

The rapprochement of the start\\nproportion to the target and the decrease in its variability went\\nhand in hand. And, the stop proportions, which are generally closer\\nto the target than the start proportions, are also less variable. It\\nseems likely that, as a rule, the smaller the variability in the\\nproportions, the closer to the target they will be placed. This\\ncorrelation is, however, by no means rigid. The start and stop\\nproportions in the single-peak condition are both considerably\\ncloser to the target at the longest target value than at the shortest\\n(Figure 7A), but their variability is about the same at these two\\nextremes (Figure 7B). Thus, in measuring variability in peak\\nperformance, it is essential to focus on its independent compo-\\nnents, the start and stop distributions, rather than on their com-\\nbined effect, which is the peak curve.\\n\\nWhen we focus on the start and stop distributions rather than on\\nthe peak curves, we see striking time-scale invariance in one\\ncomponent, namely, the variability of the stop distribution. The\\nstandard deviation of the stop distributions is close to one sixth of\\nthe mean stop time in all three single-peak conditions and in the\\ntripeak condition (Figure 8B). Equally as striking is the lack of\\ntime-scale invariance in the other component. The character of the\\nvariability in the single-peak start distributions and the striking\\nchange brought about by the tripeak procedure are best appreciated\\nby plotting runs against the logarithm of trial time (Figure 9),\\nbecause equal intervals on such a plot correspond to equal pro-\\nportions. If variability scales from one target value to another, then\\nthe raggedness of the starts and stops in these plots will be the\\nsame at different target durations.', metadata={'source': 'E:/Dropbox/zotero\\\\Gallistel et al_2004_Sources of Variability and Systematic Error in Mouse Timing Behavior.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The extreme raggedness of the starts in the single-peak condi-\\ntions—relative to the stops and relative to what is seen at the 15-s\\nhopper in the tripeak condition—suggests to us that the start\\ndistribution is a mixture distribution. It appears that on some trials,\\nthe subject does time its start relative to the remembered target,\\nwhereas on others, it starts, so to speak, as soon as it arrives at the\\nhopper. (Recall that the subject initiates a trial by poking into the\\ncontrol hopper on the other side of the test box.) These starts we\\nmight call “untimed” starts. On this hypothesis, the observed start\\ndistribution is a mixture of timed and untimed starts. As the target\\ntime gets longer, the proportion of untimed starts in this mixture\\ngets smaller. When, in the tripeak procedure, the subject is given\\nsomething else important to do prior to starting at the 15-s hopper,\\nuntimed starts disappear altogether. When they do, starts are no\\nmore variable than stops. We conclude that there is an irreducible\\nvariability in the factors that govern timing behavior, that this\\nvariability is proportional to remembered duration (i.e., it is sca-\\nlar), and that it is measured by the variability in stop behavior in\\nthe peak procedure. Stops in the peak procedure are generally\\nprecisely timed, whereas starts often are not.\\n\\nCorrelations. A positive correlation between starts and stops\\nis reliably observed when single trials of peak data are analyzed for\\ntheir correlational structure (Cheng & Westwood, 1993; Church et\\nal., 1994; Gibbon & Church, 1992; Rakitin et al., 1998). This is\\nclearly seen in our data as well. This could be explained by\\ntrial-to-trial variation in the remembered feeding latency. On trials\\nwhere the sample from memory was longer than usual, both the\\nstart and the stop would tend to be late. Alternatively, it could be\\nexplained by trial-to-trial variability in clock speed. On trials\\nwhere the clock ran slow, both the start and the stop would tend to\\n\\nbe late. A major motivation for the use of the tripeak procedure\\nwas that it would distinguish between these different sources.\\n\\nThe first explanation predicts no cross-target correlation be-\\ntween unconstrained components of run behavior in the tripeak\\ntask, whereas the second predicts that these components should be\\nas strongly correlated as the single hopper starts and stops. Stops\\non the 5-s hopper and starts on the 15-s hopper are likely to be\\ncorrelated for purely analytic reasons: the subject cannot start on\\nthe latter hopper until it has stopped on the former. However, after\\nthe filtering out of bad trials, the distributions of stops on the 5-s\\nhopper does not overlap the distribution of stops on the 15-s\\nhopper, so there is no analytic reason for the stop times on the two\\nhoppers to be correlated. They are, however, strongly correlated\\n((cid:2) (cid:1) .55, (cid:1) (cid:1) .15), about as strongly correlated as the start and\\nstop times at the 15-s hopper ((cid:2) (cid:1) .60, (cid:1) (cid:1) .07). Therefore,\\nwhatever the source of the start(cid:6)stop covariation, it is common to\\nruns controlled by two different remembered temporal targets.\\nClock variance, that is, trial-to-trial variability in timer speed, is\\nthe most obvious such source. Even if the clock rate varies during\\nthe course of the trial, when the clock is slow to approach and pass\\nthe first remembered target, then it will on average be later in\\napproaching and passing subsequent targets as well. (Consider-\\nation of the bus analogy used in the introduction may help to see\\nwhy this is so.) The cross-target start(cid:6)start and start(cid:6)stop corre-\\nlations also imply a source of variability that is common to runs\\nregulated by different samples from memory. However, these\\ncorrelations are not as suitable for estimating the importance of\\nthis common factor, given the likelihood that the start distribution\\nat the 5-s hopper is a mixture of timed and untimed starts.', metadata={'source': 'E:/Dropbox/zotero\\\\Gallistel et al_2004_Sources of Variability and Systematic Error in Mouse Timing Behavior.pdf'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='One of our key results is, however, readily interpretable in at\\nleast one alternative model. In the spectral model (Grossberg &\\nSchmajuk, 1991) and conceptually related models (Killeen &\\nFetterman, 1988; Medina, Garcia, Nores, Taylor, & Mauk, 2000),\\nthere is a spectrum of CS-activated neurons (or behavioral states)\\nwith different dynamics, such that their activity rises and subsides\\nat different latencies after the onset of the CS. Conditioned re-\\nsponses become associated only with those neurons (behavioral\\nstates) that are active when the US occurs. Thus, in our case, the\\nresponses to the different hoppers become selectively associated\\nwith neurons whose CS-triggered activities peak at the associated\\nfeeding latencies. If the dynamics of CS-activated neurons whose\\nactivity peaked at around 5 s were independent of the dynamics of\\nCS-activated neurons whose activity peaked around 15 s, then\\nthere would be no covariance between the starts and stops on the\\n5-s hopper and the starts and stops on the 15-s hopper. To explain\\nthe strong covariation reported here, one must assume a dynamic\\nfactor common to the whole spectrum of neurons, whose variation\\nfrom trial to trial rescales the rising and falling activities of them\\nall, making them all rise and fall later on some trials and earlier on\\nothers. Thus, we believe our findings have implications for any\\nkind of timing model.\\n\\nThis last point emphasizes an important aspect of this finding:\\nThere is no analytic reason for the trial-to-trial covariation in the\\nstop times at the two hoppers. The distributions do not overlap.\\nTherefore, the location within its distribution of a stop time at the\\n5-s hopper does not constrain in any way the location within its\\ndistribution of the stop time for that trial at the 15-s hopper.\\nMoreover, in their simpler forms, most timing models do not\\npredict this covariation. Thus, it is a strong constraint on possible\\nmodels.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nWe conclude, first, that the most likely source of the frequently\\nreported modest systematic error in location of peak curves rela-\\ntive to the target time is the asymmetric placement of the start and\\nstop decision criteria. In other words, the systematic error arises\\nfrom performance factors (the placement of decision criteria), not\\nmemory. We conclude, second, that trial-to-trial variability in\\nclock speed explains most of what has heretofore been ascribed to\\nmemory variability. In other words, the variability arises from an\\naspect of the learning process (the timing of the feeding latencies)\\nrather than from memory. Finally, we note that an attraction of this\\nkind of quantitative content-oriented approach to the study of\\nmemory is that it permits the functional localization of the sources\\nof error and variability. In assessing the behavioral effects of\\n\\ngenetic manipulations, establishing the functional locus of a ge-\\nnetic effect is as important as establishing the chromosomal loca-\\ntion of the mutant gene.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBevins, R.
